# Configuration Files and some Handy Scripts

Unlikely to be very useful to anyone else, but who knows.

## Configuration Files

.bashrc
.gitconfig
.inputrc
.profile
.tmux.conf
.viebrc
.vimrc

.config/user-dirs.dirs
.config/foot

## Helpers

./diffwithhome.sh   - automatically diff all files in this directory with their counterparts in $HOME
./install.sh        - install all configuration files and scripts and a bunch of other stuff - will install stuff and reconfigure apt and locales if run as root, will clobber your local configuration files in any case
