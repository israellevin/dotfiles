## Configuration Files

## Helpers

./diffwithhome.sh   - automatically diff all files in this directory with their counterparts in $HOME
./install.sh        - install all configuration files and scripts and a bunch of other stuff - will install stuff and reconfigure apt and locales if run as root, will clobber your local configuration files in any case
